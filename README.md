# set_state_app

This is Cornelius 'Neil' Meyer second Flutter App. Here I use the SetState function for
the first time. The App has a AppBar that displays two string variables. I then added a
couple of buttons that dynamically change the State of one of the string variables. That
is then in turn displayed on the AppBar

I really do now understand how Flutter is a much beloved technology. It really is enjoy-
able to work with. Much easier to get your head around than React or Angular. I really hope
the work I do on github could lead to gainful employment. The idea of doing this for a living
thrills and excites me.
